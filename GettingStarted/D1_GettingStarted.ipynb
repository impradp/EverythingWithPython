Python is Easy to Learn and Use:\n","      There is no prerequisite to start Python, since it is Ideal programming language for beginners.\n","2.   High Level Language\n","      Python don’t let you worry about low-level details, like memory management, hardware-level operations etc.\n","3.   Python is Interpreted\n","      Code is executed line-by-line directly by interpreter, and no need for separate compilation. Which means\n","        - You can run the same code across different platforms.\n","        - You can make the changes in code without restarting the program.\n","4.   Dynamic Typed\n","      Python is a dynamic language, meaning there are no need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable. Type is checked during runtime, not at compile time.\n","5.   Object Oriented:\n","      Python supports object-oriented concepts like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism etc. OOPs empowers Python with modularity, reusability and easy to maintain code.\n","6.   Extensive Library are Available:\n","      Python has huge set of library and modules, which can make development lot easier and faster."],"metadata":{"id":"xgIscmLDjRE3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **Installation**\n","Installing python in your machine is free and easy.
